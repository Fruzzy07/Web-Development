<strong><em>SO MANY REASONS TO VISIT SWITZERLAND</em></strong>
<ol>
    <li class="title">The Alps (With Exciting Outdoor Activities)</li>
    <p>The Alpine countryside is full of exciting outdoor activities from hiking to winter sports. The hiking trails are well-maintained and numerous throughout Switzerland and offer views of grand snow-capped mountains, dense pine forests, and calm rivers that match the hue of the sky.</p>
    <li class="title">Beautiful Lakes & Waterfalls</li>
    <p>Switzerland is more than just tall mountain peaks and Alpine forests. The small European nation has its fair share of beautiful lakes and waterfalls. There are more than 1,500 lakes that hold six percent of Europe’s stock of fresh water. Some of the most popular larger lakes include Lake Geneva, Lake Lucerne, and Lake Zurich.</p>
    <li class="title">Unsurpassed Public Transportation</li>
    <p>Since Switzerland is right in the middle of Europe, it’s convenient to visit other destinations such as France, Italy, Austria, Germany, and tiny Liechtenstein. They’re all assessable by train, and Switzerland’s public transportation system is well-planned with trains that are exceptionally punctual. </p>
